# Physics Engine
Building a performant physics simulator from scratch in C with OpenGL, GLAD, GLFW, and cglm.
- Traverse through the scene with keyboard and cursor controls
- Allow users to save and load previous configurations
- Model and render cubes, spheres, and equilateral tetrahedrons with custom meshes
- Use instancing to handle rendering identical meshes
- **[in progress]** Add phong lighting to rendered objects
- **[in progress]** Add skybox for easier viewing and simulation traversal
- **[in progress]** Handle millions of concurrent objects through compute shaders
